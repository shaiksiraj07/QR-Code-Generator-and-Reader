# QR-Code-Generator-and-Reader
Developed a Python application capable of generating and reading QR codes. 
Utilized the qrcode and opencv-python libraries to create and decode QR codes.
This Python application allows users to generate and read QR codes with ease. 
The project leverages the qrcode library for generating custom QR codes and opencv-python for real-time QR code scanning and decoding.
Users can customize the QR codes by embedding different types of data and can use the application to scan QR codes.
The application is designed with simplicity in mind, offering a straightforward interface for both generating and reading QR codes.

Features:

Generate QR codes with custom data.
Support for multiple data formats and error correction levels.
User-friendly interface and modular code structure.

Technologies Used:
Python
Tkinter
qrcode library
OpenCV
pyzbar
